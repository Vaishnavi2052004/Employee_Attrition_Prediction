# Employee_Attrition_Prediction
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company (attrition) or not. Using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset, the focus is on applying classification techniques to identify key factors that influence employee turnover.

The goal is to assist HR departments in making data-driven decisions by highlighting the most influential features (like Overtime, Job Satisfaction, and Monthly Income) that contribute to employee attrition. By understanding these patterns, companies can take proactive steps to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

The model is trained using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
